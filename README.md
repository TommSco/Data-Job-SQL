# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data scientist job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from Luke Barousse's SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data scientist job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Scientist
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    demand_count > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```
